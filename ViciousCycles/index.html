        <!--After watching the project check in session, I saw that we were to add the pages (other than index) to a html folder.  Once I did this, I changed the code here to add the folder in each nav on each page, but after changing it I was not able to make the navigation work.  I simplified it again so that it worked, but still need to work on this to move to a folder. I had the link "html/about.html" as an example.  Do you have any suggestions on how to move files and save them properly so they still work?-->

<!--What I would like to do is make a grid, alternating text and images. I had some success doing this on the about me page. I had trouble making this work on the home page. I will continue to work on making this layout work, and if I have troubule I will contact you or the ILC.-->

<!--I am intending also to add three boxes underneath with focused text and links to the bixes, services, and events pages. I was going to tie this into the grid that I was planning to create. When I am able to make the top section work I will try to add these and line them up.-->
